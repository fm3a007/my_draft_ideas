This directory contains some utility modules for general programming 
which came from Liang,David's personal ideas. The author wrote these
codes mainly due to his personal interst, and he hope them  would be 
useful for you.

These modules are released under the GPLv3 license.

As we never want to rebuild the wheel, some of the modules contained here
depend on some other libraries. These depending libraries are not collected
into this directory. In order to compile the codes in this directory, you 
should download them by yourself.
